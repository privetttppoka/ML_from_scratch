# ML_from_scratch
This repository contains implementations of classic machine learning algorithms written from scratch in Python, without relying on high-level libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of ML fundamentals, mathematical concepts, and how algorithms work under the hood.
